<P></P>Background
Uganda’s location in the Great Lakes region is strategic for providing assistance to refugees. Following the renewed outbreak of civil war in South Sudan in September 2016 and ongoing conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Government of Uganda and UNHCR estimate that Uganda is presently hosting 1,239,912 refugees. Of these, 808,554 are from South Sudan, 332,506 from the Congo, 38,526 from Burundi, 27,899 from Somalia and 17,257 from other countries.</P>
<p>The bulk of the South Sudanese refugees are in the West Nile region while most of the Congolese are in Western and Southwestern Uganda.
The high presence of refugees puts pressure on resources available in hosting communities and creates a pressing challenge to ensure protection of the new arrivals. At the same time, Uganda is facing post-conflict recovery in the northern region, which has been affected by rebel insurgency up until 2007. In the pastoral region of Karamoja in the northeast the situation is transitioning from armed conflict to community development.</p>
